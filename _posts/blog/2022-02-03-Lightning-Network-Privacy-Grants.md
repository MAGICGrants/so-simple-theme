MAGIC Grants, a 501(c)(3) public charity that supports public cryptocurrency infrastructure, is pleased to announce 2 research grants to investigate improved privacy on the Bitcoin Lightning Network!

This grant is made possible by pledges from zkSNACKs Ltd. (Wasabi Wallet; 1 BTC), Dan Gershony (0.1 BTC), and Spiral (previously Square Crypto; 1 BTC). These contributions are tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Researchers are encouraged to **apply by March 14th, 2022** as teams or individuals. The Lightning Network Privacy Committee will select 2 winning teams (individuals selected will be organized into a team) by March 31st, 2022. Research teams will have **until the end of the year to submit their research papers.**

Grant recipients will receive 20% of the grant value up-front and 80% after the paper is reviewed and accepted by the committee. MAGIC Grants can pay recipients in BTC, USD, EUR, or other assets, and we can agree to pay a fixed amount of BTC or a fiat-pegged value for the second payout. We can accommodate a lot of payment flexibility following our [MAGIC Fund Grant Disbursement Process and Requirements](/funds/MAGIC Fund Grant Disbursement Process and Requirements.pdf).

## Applying

To apply, please email [LNGrant@magicgrants.org](mailto:LNGrant@magicgrants.org) on or before March 14th.

You do not need to include all of your ideas in the application. Please apply with your exploration plans, experience, and credentials. It is expected that you will come up with and explore various ideas during the research period; these do not need to be established in the initial application.
