MAGIC Grants aspires to make a more formal plan for 2022 as it scales up its operations to meet the growing needs of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

In 2021, MAGIC Grants primarily conducted these activities:

* Issued three (3) undergraduate scholarships

* Supported the 2021 [Cryptocurrency Village at DEF CON](https://cryptocurrencyvillage.net)

* Initiated its MAGIC Funds community program

Continuing in 2022, MAGIC Grants hopes to:

* Initiate three (3) independent MAGIC Funds for different communities and projects

* Expand its scholarship program as funds allow

* Fund five times as many grants as 2021 through the MAGIC Funds
